BUILD-README

Short instructions to build the solution and collect DLLs into a single folder.

REQUIREMENTS

* .NET SDK installed (dotnet --version should work)
* Scripts placed in the repo root next to Entitas.sln:

  * macOS/Linux: build.sh
  * Windows: build.ps1
* Resulting assemblies are written to the Artifacts/ folder in the repo root.

MACOS / LINUX

1. Make the script executable (once):
   chmod +x ./build.sh
2. Build (Release by default):
   ./build.sh
3. Build Debug:
   ./build.sh Debug
   Output: ./Artifacts

WINDOWS (POWERSHELL)

1. Open PowerShell in the repo root.
   If execution policy blocks the script, for the current session run:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
2. Build (Release by default):
   .\build.ps1
3. Build Debug:
   .\build.ps1 Debug
   Output: .\Artifacts

WHAT THE SCRIPTS DO

* Build the entire solution into a shared temporary folder.
* Copy only primary project DLLs (no dependencies, no PDBs) into Artifacts.
* Exclude test projects and Unity Editor tooling by default.

NOTES

* To keep PDB files, remove the MSBuild properties: -p\:DebugSymbols=false and -p\:DebugType=None from the scripts.
* To include or exclude specific projects, edit the .csproj search filters inside the scripts.
* The scripts clean the temporary folder (.buildout) and the Artifacts folder on each run.
